Welcome to my web page
I am going to make a list for disney rides from best to worst. (now a list like this will be subjective)


1.Buzz lightyear space rangers spin.
I put this one first because it is a really fun ride. It is a ride that anyone can enjoy. It is a clasic.

2.Flight of passage
I think that this ride is just amazing I mean really you are on a banshee flying and doing all sorts of stuff.

3.Slinky
I am a big fan of this ride I think it is amazing.There is not much else to say.

4.Big thunder
A classic ride that many people have rode and will ride.
